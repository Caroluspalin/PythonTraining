Python Training & Exercises 🐍
A collection of Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts. This repository documents my journey learning Python as part of my IT studies, covering everything from basic variables to file handling and data structures.

📖 Overview
This project serves as a practical archive of various Python exercises, showcasing different problem-solving techniques and syntax mastery. Each file focuses on a specific topic, ranging from simple arithmetic operations to more complex logic involving loops, conditions, and external data processing.

The scripts are designed to be standalone examples of "clean code" principles and Pythonic best practices.

📂 Repository Structure & Topics

Here is a breakdown of what each module covers:

variables_and_input.py

Basic I/O operations (input/print).

String formatting (f-strings) and decimal precision.

Mathematical calculations (VAT, rounding).

loops_conditions_exceptions.py

Control flow (If/Else logic).

Iteration (For & While loops).

Error handling (try-except blocks for robust input validation).

Compound interest calculators.

lists_and_operations.py

List manipulation (Sorting, Reversing, Filtering).

Lambda functions and list comprehensions.

Analyzing data sets (Min, Max, Sum, Average).

Example: Sudoku row validation logic.

functions_and_arguments.py

Defining reusable functions with parameters.

Return values vs. void functions.

Date and time calculations (datetime module).

Recursion and mathematical algorithms (e.g., Pyramids).

strings_string_manipulation.py

Text processing (Slicing, Concatenation).

Palindrome checkers.

Analyzing character frequency and substrings.

dictionaries_and_tuples.py

Key-Value pair data structures.

Storing complex data (e.g., Team roles).

Iterating through dictionary keys and values.

File_reading.py

Reading and parsing external files (TXT, CSV).

Data analysis from real-world datasets (e.g., City bike statistics).

Handling FileNotFoundError gracefully.
